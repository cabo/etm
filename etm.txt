                 We're gonna need a bigger threat model
                          draft-farrell-etm-00

Abstract

   We argue that an expanded threat model is needed for Internet
   protocol development as protocol endpoints can no longer be
   considered to be generally trustworthy for any general definition of
   "trustworthy."

   This draft will be a submission to the DEDR IAB workshop.

1.  Introduction

   [[There's a github repo for this -- issues and PRs are welcome there.
   <https://github.com/sftcd/etm> ]]

   [RFC3552], Section 3 defines an "Internet Threat Model" which has
   been commonly used when developing Internet protocols.  That assumes
   that "the end-systems engaging in a protocol exchange have not
   themselves been compromised."  RFC 3552 is a formal part of of the
   IETF's process as it is also BCP72.

   Since RFC 3552 was written, we have seen a greater emphasis on
   considering privacy and [RFC6973] provides privacy guidance for
   protocol developers.  RFC 6973 is not a formal BCP, but appears to

   have been useful for protocol developers as it is referenced by 38
   later RFCs at the time of writing [1].

   BCP188, [RFC7258] subsequently recognised pervasive monitoring as a
   particular kind of attack and has also been relatively widely
   referenced (39 RFCs at the time of writing [2]).  To date, perhaps
   most documents referencing BCP188 have considered state-level or in-
   network adversaries.

   In this document, we argue that we need to epxand our threat model to
   acknowledge that today many applications are themselves rightly
   considered potential adversaries for at least some relevant actors.
   We also argue that not recognising this reality causes Internet
   protocol designs to sometimes fail to protect the systems and users
   who depend on those.

   Discussion related to expanding our concept of threat-model ought not
   (but perhaps inevitably will) involve discussion of weakening how
   confidentiality is provided in Internet protocols.  Whilst it may
   superficially seem to be the case that allowing in-network
   interception could allow detection of adversarial application
   behaviours, such a position is clearly mistaken once one notes that
   adding middleboxes that can themselves be adverserial cannot be a
   solution for adversarial code.  It is also the case that the IETF has
   consensus on this topic, as noted in [RFC2404] and BCP 200 [RFC1984].

   It is unclear whether or not the IETF can be expected to reach rough
   consensus on a description of such a new threat model, but we further
   argue that ignoring this aspect of deployed reality cannot may not
   bode well for Internet protocol development.

   Absent such an expanded threat model, we expect to see a continued
   mismatch between expectaions and the deployment reality for some
   Internet protocols.

   This internet-draft is a submission to the IAB's DEDR workshop [3]
   and is not intended to become an RFC.

   We are saddened by, and apologise for, the somewhat dystopian
   impression that this document may impart - hopefully, there's a bit
   of hope at the end;-)

2.  Examples of deliberate adversarial behaviour in applications

   In this section we describe a few documented examples of deliberate
   adversarial behaviour by applications that could affect Internet
   protocol development.  The adversarial behaviours described below
   involve various kinds of attack, varying from simlple fraud, to

   credential theft, surveillance and contributing to DDoS attacks.
   This is not intended to be a comprehensive nor complete survey, but
   to motivate us to consider deliberate adversarial behaviour by
   applicaions.  Finally, we note that while we have these examples of
   deliberate adversarial behaviour, there are also many example of
   applciations deveopers doing their best to protect the security and
   privacy of their users or customers.

2.1.  Malware in curated application stores

   Despite the best efforts of curators, so-called AppStores have
   frequently been (ab)used to distribute malware of many kinds and one
   recent study [curated] claims that simple obfuscation enables malware
   to avoid detection.  Given the scale of these deployments, even a
   small percentage of malware-infected applictions can affect a huge
   numbers of people.

2.2.  Virtual private networks (VPNs)

   Virtual private networks (VPNs) are supposed to hide user traffic to
   various degrees depending on the particular technology chosen by the
   VPN provider.  However, not all VPNs do what they say, some for
   example misrepresenting the countries in which they provide vantage
   points. [vpns]

2.3.  Compromised (home) networks

   What we normally might consider networking appliances do also run
   applications that can end up being adversarial, for example DNS and
   DHCP attacks from home routers, or other devices in the home.  One
   study [home] reports on a 2011 attack that affected 4.5 million DSL
   modems in Brazil.  The absence of software update [RFC8240] has been
   a major cause of these issues and rises to the level that considering
   this as intentional behaviour is warranted.

2.4.  Web browsers

   Tracking of users in order to support advertising based business
   models is ubiquitous on the Internet today.  HTTP header fields (such
   as cookies) are commonly used for such tracking, as are structures
   within the content of HTTP responses such as links to 1x1 pixel
   images and (ab)use of Javascript APIs offered by browsers.
   [tracking]

   While some web users may be sanguine about this kind of tracking in
   some contexts, other users consider this behaviour unwelcome, when or
   if they are informed that it happens, [attitude] though the evidence
   here seems somewhat harder to interpret and many studies (that we



Farrell                 Expires October 24, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                     etm                        April 2019


   have found to date) involve small numbers of users.  Historically,
   browsers have not made this kind of tracking visible and have
   supported it by default, though some recent browser versions are
   starting to enable visibility and blocking of tracking.  Browsers are
   also increasingly imposing more stringent requirements on plug-ins
   for security reasons.

2.5.  Web sites

   Many web sites today provide some form of privacy policy and terms of
   service, that are mostly unread. [unread] This implies that, legal
   fiction aside, users of those sites have not in reality agreed to the
   specific terms published and so users are therefore highly exposed to
   being exploited by web sites, for example [cambridge] is a recent
   well-publicised case where a service provider abused the data of 87
   million users via a partnership.  While many web site operators claim
   that they care deeply about privacy, it seems prudent to assume that
   some do not in fact care about user privacy, or at least not in ways
   with which many of their users would agree.  And of course, today's
   web sites are actually mostly fairly complex web applications and are
   no longer static sets of HTML files, so calling these "web sites" is
   perhaps a misnomer, but considered as web applications, it seems
   clear that many such exist that are adversarial.

2.6.  Tracking bugs in mail

   Some mail user agents (MUAs) render HTML content by default (some not
   allowing this to be turned off, perhaps particularly MUAs on mobile
   devices) and thus enable the same kind of adversarial tracking as is
   seen on the web.  Such intentional tracking is also seen many times
   per day by email users - in one study [mailbug] the authors estimated
   that 62% of PII leakage to third parties was intentional, for example
   if leaked data included a hash of the recipient email address.

2.7.  Smart televisions

   There have been examples of so-called "smart" televisions spying on
   their owners without permission [4] and one survey of user attitudes
   [smarttv] found "broad agreement was that it is unacceptable for the
   data to be repurposed or shared" although the level of user
   understanding may be questionable.  What is clear though is that such
   devices generally have not provided controls for their owners that
   would allow them to meaningfully make a decision as to whether or not
   they want to share such data.

2.8.  So-called Internet of things

   Many so-called Internet of Things (IoT) devices ("so-called" since
   all devices were already things:-) have been found extremely
   deficient when their security and privacy aspects were analysed, for
   example children's toys. [toys] While in some cases this may be due
   to incompetence rather than deliberate, the levels of incompetence
   frequently seen imply that it is valid to consider such cases as not
   being accidental.

3.  Inadvertent adversarial behaviours

   Not all adversarial behaviour by applications is deliberate, some is
   likely due to carelessness and/or due to erroneous assumptions about
   the environments in which applications (now) run.  For the sake of
   brevity, we simply list some such cases:

   o  Application abuse for command and control, for example, use of IRC
      or apache logs for malware command and control [5]

   o  Carelessly leaky buckets [6], for example, lots of Amazon S3 leaks
      showing that careless admins can too easily cause application
      server data to become available to adversaries

   o  Virtualisation exposing secrets, for example Meltdown and Spectre
      [7] and similar side-channels

   o  Compromised badly-maintained web sites, for example that have lead
      to massive online databases of passwords [8]

   o  Supply-chain attacks, for example the Target attack [9]

   o  Breaches of major service providers, that many of us might have
      assumed would be sufficiently capable to be the best large-scale
      "Identity providers", for example:

      *  3 billion accounts: yahoo [10]

      *  many millions at risk: telcos selling location data [11]

      *  50 million accounts: facebook [12]

      *  14 million accounts: verizon [13]

      *  "hundreds of thousands" of accounts: google [14]

      *  unknown numbers, some email content exposed: microsoft [15]

   o  Breaches of smaller service providers: Too many to enumerate,
      sadly

4.  Possible directions for an expanded threat model

   We don't claim to have any definitive solutions or answers but simply
   call out some potential directions that could be explored at the DEDR
   workshop and thereafter.

4.1.  Develop a BCP for privacy considerations

   It may be time for the IETF to develop a BCP for privacy
   considerations, possibly starting from [RFC6973].

4.2.  Consider the user perspective

   [I-D.nottingham-for-the-users] argues that, in relevant cases where
   there are conflicting requirements, the "IETF considers end users as
   its highest priority concern."  It seems that doing so is consistent
   with the expanded threat model being argued for here.

4.3.  Consider ABuse-cases as well as use-cases

   Protocol developers and those implementing and deploying Internet
   technologies are typically most interested in a few specific use-
   cases for which they need solutions.  Expanding our threat model to
   include adversarial application behaviours [abusecases] seems likely
   to call for significant attention to be paid to potential abuses of
   whatever new or re-purposed technology is being considered.

   Protocol extensibility mechanisms may constitute a particular vector
   for abuse-cases, given that designers cannot fully analyse their
   impact at the time a new protocol is defined or standardised.  One
   might consider then that a lack of extensibility could be a virtue
   for some new protocols, in contrast to earlier assumptions.

4.4.  Isolation

   Sophisticated users can deal with some potentially adversarial
   behaviours in client applications by using different instances of
   such applications, for example, differently configured web browsers
   for use in different contexts.  Applications (including web browsers)
   and operating systems are also building in isolation via use of
   different processes or sandboxing.
   Protocol artefacts that relate to uses of such isolation mechanisms
   might be worth considering.





Farrell                 Expires October 24, 2019                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                     etm                        April 2019


   To an extent, the IETF has already recognised some of these issues as
   being in-scope, e.g.  when considering the linkability issues with
   mechanisms such as TLS session tickets, or QUIC connection
   identifiers.

4.5.  Minimise

   As recommended in [RFC6973] data minimisation and additional
   encryption are likely to be helpful - if applications don't ever see
   data, or a cleartext form of data, then they should have a harder
   time misbehaving.  Similarly, not adding new long-term identifiers,
   and not exposing existing ones, would seem helpful.

4.6.  Transparency

   Certificate transparency (CT) [RFC6962] has been an effective
   countermeasure for X.509 certificate mis-issuance, which is a known
   application layer misbehaviour.  While the context in which CT
   operates is very constrained (essentially to the public CAs trusted
   by web browsers), similar approaches could be useful for other
   protocols or technologies.

   In addition, legislative requirements such as those imposed by the
   GDPR for subject access to data [16] could lead to a desire to handle
   internal data structures and databases in ways that are reminiscent
   of CT, though clearly with signifnant authorisation being required
   and without the append-only nature of a CT log.

4.7.  Same-Origin Policy

   The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) [RFC6454] may provide an example of how
   going beyond the RFC 3552 threat model can be useful.

4.8.  Greasing

   The TLS protocol [RFC8446] now supports the use of GREASE
   [I-D.ietf-tls-grease] as a way to mitigate on-path ossification.
   While this technique is not likely to prevent any deliberate
   misbehaviours, it may demonstrate that network protocol mechanisms
   can have impact in this space, if we spend the time to try analyse
   the incentives of the various parties.

5.  Conclusions

   At this stage we don't think it approriate to claim that any strong
   conclusion can be reached based on the above.  We do however, claim
   that the is a topic that could be worth discussion at the DEDR
   workshop and elsewhere.

6.  Security Considerations

   This draft is all about security, and privacy.

   Encryption is one of the most effective tools in countering network
   based attackers and will also have a role in protecting against
   adversarial applications.  However, today many existing tools for
   countering adversarial applications assume they can inspect network
   traffic to or from potentially adversarial applications.  These facts
   of course cause tensions (e.g. see [RFC8404]).  Expanding our threat
   model could possibly help reduce some of those tensions, if it leads
   to the development of protocols that make exploitation harder or more
   transparent for adversarial applications.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
